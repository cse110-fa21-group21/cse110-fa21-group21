## Ramifications

- **_The following subpoints are the expectations that we as a team have when our team rules are violated._**
  - **_We will separate the issue from the individual..._**
    - Someone's inability to accomplish a task is not reflective of the individuals, rather the situation they find themselves in. In mediating, we assume that no lapse is due to a lack of character.

    - As a group, we will find further solutions if needed.
  - **_We will keep others accountable for their workload..._**
    - Through weekly meetings and reflections, we will check in with each other.
  - **_We will be open to feedback_**
    - When our teammates find an issue with our work or lack thereof, we will make an effort to picture what it is that has foreced their hand into conflict.
