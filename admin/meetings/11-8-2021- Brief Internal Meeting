          - Example: Local storage vs remote data bases OR Using SPA 
              - How does it help? 
              - Why did we choose it? Pros and cons? 
                  - Pros: We had an assignment that taught us how to implement a SPA and none of us know how to do a multi page application. 
                  - Cons: more technical implementation, may be harder 
              - Are there any drawbacks? 
                  - Lots of client side rendering/ attention from the user
                  - need to write extra javascript to hide and show stuff so adds to technical stuff.
      - API group: Use postman? Pass inputs and find out what the API spits out. 
          - Brainstorm what we need from the API and research CICD pipeline so we can start implementing.

**Taks:**
   - Put in all the tasks in the project board for all teams
