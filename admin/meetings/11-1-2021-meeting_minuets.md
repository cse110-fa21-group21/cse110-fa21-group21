# Pitch
Sherilyn gives the pitch
#### feedback from Hema
- make sure to check how Spoonacular gives us price info(is it accurate? is it state by state?)
- Hema thinks that we should maybe think about adding a way to update recipes and store them locally
- Cade asked how the API should be keeping track of favoirites, and how Spoonacular will match favorites to recipes in the API
- Which features are we goingn to drop?
- weekwise project roadmap
- system diagram
- EXPLORE GROCERY LIST OPTION NOW
- github project board(meet to discusss code 
- minigroups, meeting often.  everyone will meet once/twice a week
- wireframe => HTML
- wireframe => different calls
- add SHARE(ie with text message) option to wireframe
- Talk to Hema(system diagram, roadmap, cleaned up grocery list)




#### shopping list
- are we going to add to shoping list by recepies(ie have a list of recepeis to click on, then have a new page that actually has list of ingredients
- OR are we going to implement, somehow, tags on each engredient so we can add and delete recipes from one big ingredients list.

# Finishing Up
