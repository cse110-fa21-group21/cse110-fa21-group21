# {short title of solved problem and solution}

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Angelina, Cade, Ludvig, Maggie (possibilty there were more, I just listed who were in the meeting)
* Date: 2021-11-06 (in html_group meeting)

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to decide whether to have a Single Page Application or a Multi Page Application.

## Considered Options

* Single Page Application
* Multi Page Application

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Single Page Application", because
* None of us have experience in MPA, while for SPA lab7 gave an example of how to do it.
* SPA is enough to satify our need for the features.
* MPA costs more time but we have only a few weeks.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* {e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …}
* …

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* {e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …}
* …

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Single Page Application

* Good, because development and testing for a SPA is simple
* Good, because we have an example from the lab
* Bad, because might not be able to achieve some complicated features

### Multi Page Application

* Good, because MPA is flexible; we can add new pages for new contents and features freely
* Bad, because development of MPA costs too much time
* Bad, because we need to make the same set of icons/buttons multiple times for each page which waste time
* Good, because for the system diagram (drawn before decision on S/MPA) we have MPA
