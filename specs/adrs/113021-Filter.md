# Filtering the List of Recipes by Certain Categories

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to figure out which categories we wanted to filter our recipes by and how we should approach doing so. Would sorting by score, time, price, cuisine, or ingredients be some categories to consider? Also, the way we filter needs to be talked about as well (i.e. checklists, drop-down menus, text input).

## Considered Options

- Option A: By score, checklist.
- Option B: By price, checklist.
- Option C: By time, checklist.
- Option D: By cuisine, drop-down.
- Option E: By ingredients, text-input.
- Option F: By dietary, checklist.
- Option G: By type of meal, drop-down.

## Decision Outcome

We chose options B, C, D, E, G for now.

- Reason 1: We chose to do a filter by price using a checklist with a range of prices. This way those that would like a cheap meal, medium value meal, or maybe an expensive meal could filter through and make their choices.

- Reason 2: We chose to do a filter by time using a checklist with a range of times. If a person has a lot of time to cook, they may be able to choose a recipe that requires more time, but there could be those that only have time to make a quick meal as well.

- Reason 3: Since there are so many cuisines, we decided that a drop-down menu may be the best choice for this going forward. Although it only allows for one cuisine choice to be made at a time, it will make the view less convoluted.

- Reason 4: We decided that again, with so many ingredient combinations that can be chosen, the best bet would be a text-input based filter. There could be hundreds or thousands of different ingredients out there that even for a drop-down menu it wouldn't be feasible.

- Reason 5: We did a checklist for the dietary option because we would assume that the user would like to limit the recipes they'd like to see based on their dietary preferences.

- Reason 6: The couple of options we left out like score, doesn't really make sense to have. Would a user want to search up a low scoring recipe? How often would that even happen? Other types of filtering may not be able to be easily implemented with the amount of time that we have to work with.

### Benefits of this decisions: <!-- optional -->

- Improves the functionality of our application for users using our app. They are able to lessen the amount of recipes they have to look at while looking for what they may want.

- Gives our app more versatility with more categories to filter by, users could further limit their searches to be more specific about what they would like to find.

### Consequences of this decision <!-- optional -->

- Many issues can arise with more categories to filter by. We would have to make sure that all the categories will work with each other and that bugs won't show up.

- With more categories comes more decisions to be made if it's a good idea to include and also more time invested into it (that we may not have).

- Could get really cluttering if the filters we include aren't going to even be used by the user a lot.

## Pros and Cons of the other Options

It is nice to be able to filter by all the categories show on the card, but that may not be possible given the time that we have and the information that we have fetched.

For example, one cool filtering feature could be checking for multiple ingredients. If the recipe has cheese, eggs, milk, and ham show that recipe. However, searching time could increase with multiple ingredients (potentially slowing down our website) and that is something we need to invest time in to test to make sure that it works correctly.
